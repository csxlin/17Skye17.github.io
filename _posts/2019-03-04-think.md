Some thinking abount human nature and living style these days.

These days I've been thinking some questions that I've never thought about.
1. Why some people like to amuse themselves by abusing others?
2. Why can't I get angry with someone who violated my right?

There is a saying in China,"Don't put those disgusting things on others"(己所不欲勿施于人)
Some people get used to it, while others don't obey it. So here is the problem:
If someone wants something from you, maybe he/she thinks that you are rich or you have extra resources, 
so it's OK to take some from you. But the truth is I'm neither rich nor have rich resources, I am struggling to survive
but someone wants to end my peaceful life by grabing my resources.

Yep, I'm arguing with some guy occupied my computing resource without telling me in advance. Maybe this is the right time
to show the power of communicaton, I've tried to explain my situation with her that I don't have extra computing resources,
but yet, she is still using the machine as it is her right to be the new host. 

Talking to her makes me feel tried and disappointed, so I spent over 20 hours installing the packages on other machines.
I can continue to work now, but the faded 20 hours which ought to be my doorout time and last disgusting weekend makes me feel down.
